7.6 Program Study Duration  
The minimum allowed study duration is nine main  semesters.  
The maximum allowed study duration is twenty main semesters (ten years), which does not include frozen 
semesters for reasons accepted by the Faculty of Engineering Council, after which the student is dismissed 
from the  programs.  
 
7.7 Degree Awarding Requirements  
To obtain the Bachelor of Science Degree in Computer Engineering  and Software Systems , the student 
must successfully complete the required Credit Hours in the program with a GPA at graduation of at least  
2.0. 
The student must pass all zero -credit courses in the Program.  
A graduation  project  is an essential  part of the program  requirements  for graduation.  The graduation 
project may be completed over two successive semesters, as per the program requirement,  and the student  
will not graduate  unless  he fulfils  the project  pass requirements. The student must earn at least 130 Credit 
Hours to register for the graduation project. If the project is divided along two semesters, the student must 
register  them in their  order.  
The student must perform Field Training for 12 weeks during his study  duration.  
The student can study a number of courses in another University which has a cooperation agreement with 
Ain Shams University regarding the transfer of Cred its. This requires prior approval from the Faculty of 
Engineering, Ain Shams University. The Credit Hours of these courses are included in the student's 
graduation requirements, provided that the total Credit Hours of these courses do not exceed 68 Credit  
Hours.  
 
7.8 Field Training  
The student  must  perform  Field  Training  for 12 weeks  in an industrial  or service  facility  related to the 
student's program and must be under the full supervision of the faculty. It is also possible to perform the 
training inside the faculty in a similar  environment.  
The training follow -up will be handled by the academic advisor assigned by the Program Steering  
Committee.  
The training  is divided  into periods  of 4 weeks  at the end of the first, second, and  third  levels. (Can be in 
the fourth level as well open during the  semester)  
 
7.9 Academic Advisor  
Every student is assigned an Academic Advisor who follows -up the student academic progress and assists 
him in selecting the courses each semester.  
The Program Academi c Advisor is responsible for:  
- Helping the student to choose his academic path and helps him to select courses each semester.  
- Helping the student with the choice of the Field Training.  
- Helping the student with the choice of concentration and graduation project.
